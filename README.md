Rhoxena is an interactive web project that looks to bring a story to life in a game-like way by using only HTML, CSS, and JS. The project is inspired by various sci-fi works such as Marathon, Dead Space, Metroid, System Shock, and Halo. The project follows an unidentified agent who is sent to a research colony on a volatile planet after receiving orders from their organization to investigate a distress signal. Upon arrival, the agent finds the colony completely deserted and it seems there is a threat lurking in the shadows. The game's name, Rhoxena, refers to the alien species that the player encounters in similar vein to the Metroid franchise.
